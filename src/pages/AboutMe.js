                Hi there, I'm Ivan Ortega. I am a self taught, DIY(do it yourself) enthusiast with a passion for music, code, and everything in between. I have studied many kinds of code languages and I am always asking for a challenge. I thrive in a fast workspace and do so with the least amount of stress and the greatest amount of enthusiasm (also because I don't like when it's slow... I get way too bored). Aside from my coding experience I have worked in the hospitality industry for 11+ years, so I am quite astonishing dealing with ordeals down to the smallest dilemmas. I as well produce my own music. I have released 3+ songs on all the music platforms and am working on many more in the meantime. Having learned and self taught most of these skills, I hope to apply both code and music in all my projects to achieve something unique and stylish.

                <div className='about__img'>
                  <Flip right delay={4000} duration={1000}>
                    <img src={ image } alt='Ivan image'/>
                  </Flip>
                </div>
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        </Fade>
    </div>
